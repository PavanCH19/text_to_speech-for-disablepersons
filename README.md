        <p>In our React-based project with Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion and an AI Chatbot using Botpress, here are the technical aspects:</p>
        
        <h2>Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Web Speech API</strong>'s <code>SpeechSynthesis</code> interface is used for converting text to speech directly in the browser. The app will read it aloud when triggered.</p>

        <h2>AI Chatbot Integration with Botpress</h2>
        <p>Integrate the <strong>Botpress</strong> chatbot by embedding its web widget into the React app. The chatbot will process user queries, provide responses, and trigger the TTS output.</p>
        
        <h2>Botpress Setup</h2>
        <p>Host the Botpress bot using its in-built webhooks and APIs. The chatbot’s responses can be fetched and processed via HTTP requests within React.</p>

        <h2>User Interaction</h2>
        <p>Provide a chat interface where users can type messages, interact with the chatbot, and have the chatbot’s responses read aloud via TTS.</p>

        <h2>No Backend Required</h2>
        <p>Since Botpress can run as a standalone service and the TTS functionality is handled by the browser, there is no need for a backend in your project.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive elements (chat, TTS controls) to make the platform accessible to users with disabilities.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This approach ensures that the project remains lightweight, fully functional, and does not require a backend, using only React for the frontend integration of TTS and the Botpress-based AI chatbot.</p>
