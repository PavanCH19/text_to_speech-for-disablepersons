# Text-to-Speech Converter

In our **React-based project** with **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion** and an **AI Chatbot** using **Botpress**, here are the technical aspects:

## Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration
The **Web Speech API**'s `SpeechSynthesis` interface is used for converting text to speech directly in the browser. The app will read it aloud when triggered.

## AI Chatbot Integration with Botpress
Integrate the **Botpress** chatbot by embedding its web widget into the React app. The chatbot will process user queries, provide responses, and trigger the TTS output.

## Botpress Setup
Host the **Botpress** bot using its in-built webhooks and APIs. The chatbot’s responses can be fetched and processed via HTTP requests within React.

## User Interaction
Provide a chat interface where users can type messages, interact with the chatbot, and have the chatbot’s responses read aloud via TTS.

## No Backend Required
Since **Botpress** can run as a standalone service and the TTS functionality is handled by the browser, there is no need for a backend in your project.

## Accessibility
Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive elements (chat, TTS controls) to make the platform accessible to users with disabilities.

This approach ensures that the project remains **lightweight** and fully functional **without a backend**, using only **React** for the frontend integration of TTS and Botpress-based AI.
